## Origins & Early Life

Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt was born into Prussian aristocracy. His father was Major Alexander Georg von Humboldt, an officer in the army of Frederick the Great. His mother, Maria Elisabeth Colomb, came from a family of Huguenots (French Protestants who fled after Louis XIV revoked religious liberty in 1685).

His father died in 1779 when Alexander was ten. He and his elder brother Wilhelm (who became a famous linguist and philosopher) were raised by their mother—an unemotional woman of strict Calvinist beliefs who prioritized their education but showed little warmth.

Young Alexander showed early interest in natural history, collecting plants, insects, and shells. He was called "the little apothecary" by his family for his specimen collections.

## Quotes

> "Nature considered rationally, that is to say, submitted to the process of thought, is a unity in diversity of phenomena; a harmony, blending together all created things."

> "The most important aim of all physical science is this: to recognize unity in diversity."

> "It is far more difficult to observe correctly than most men imagine; to behold is not necessarily to observe, and the power of comparing and combining is only to be obtained by education."

> "If instead of geographic maps, we only possessed tables covering latitude, longitude, and altitude, a great number of curious connections that continents manifest in their forms would have stayed forever lost."

> "Everything is interconnected."

## Connection to Strata Package

Humboldt embodies the **transformation and processing** philosophy of `strata.humboldt`: **seek connections and reveal unity in diversity**.

Just as Humboldt transformed raw observations (temperatures, elevations, plant species) into isotherms, altitude profiles, and biogeographic zones—revealing hidden patterns—the Humboldt module transforms raw geographic data into meaningful maps through:

- Geometric operations (subtract, merge, dissolve)
- Spatial analysis (merge_touching for cross-border features)
- Coordinate transformations
- Topology simplification

Humboldt's greatest insight was that isolated data points become meaningful only through comparison and combination. The same principle applies to cartographic processing: individual shapefiles become maps only through transformation.
