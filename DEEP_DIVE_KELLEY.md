## Origins & Early Life

Florence Molthrop Kelley was born into an intellectually stimulating and politically engaged household. Her father, William Darrah Kelley (1814-1890), was a U.S. Congressman from Pennsylvania who served 15 consecutive terms—the longest-serving Republican in history at that time. Known as "Pig Iron" Kelley for his advocacy of protective tariffs, he was also a committed abolitionist.

Her father took young Florence to visit steel and glass factories, showing her children working in dangerous conditions. These childhood experiences shaped her lifelong commitment to labor reform. She was largely educated at home due to childhood illnesses, developing early habits of intensive reading and research.

## Hull House Maps: Technical Details

The Hull House Maps (1895) were revolutionary data visualizations. Here's what made them groundbreaking:

### Data Collection Method
- Door-to-door surveys of every residence in Chicago's Nineteenth Ward
- Questionnaires recorded:
  - Nationality/ethnicity of all residents
  - Weekly wages of wage-earners
  - Employment type
  - Number of family members
- Data collected in collaboration with U.S. Bureau of Labor

### Map Design
- Based on Charles Booth's London poverty maps
- Two main maps:
  - **Nationalities Map:** 18 colors representing different ethnic groups
  - **Wages Map:** Color gradations showing income levels
- Scale: Individual buildings shown
- Highly detailed: "each house, tenement and room is shown"

### Visual Innovation
- **Immediate pattern recognition:** "By looking at just eight pages, the reader could easily see the clustering of nationalities and the distribution of families' weekly wages"
- Made social conditions visible to middle-class reformers and legislators
- Proved correlation between low wages and poor housing
- Evidence-based advocacy: data, not just rhetoric

### Influence
- Model for subsequent social surveys nationwide

## Connection to Strata Package

Kelley embodies the **visualization** philosophy of `strata.kelley`: **maps are evidence, not decoration**.

Just as Kelley transformed raw census data and door-to-door surveys into maps that revealed hidden patterns—the clustering of nationalities, the geography of poverty—the Kelley module transforms processed geographic data into meaningful visualizations:

- SVG generation that serves comprehension
- Color schemes with purpose
- Layer ordering for clarity
- Output formats accessible to "the plain man"

Kelley's insight was that properly visualized data reveals patterns invisible in tables and numbers. A map of wages tells a story that columns of figures cannot. The same principle applies to cartographic output: the goal is not pretty pictures but understanding made visible.
