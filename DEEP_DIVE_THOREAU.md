## Origins & Early Life

Henry David Thoreau was born David Henry Thoreau in Concord, Massachusetts, into a modest New England family. His father, John Thoreau, was a pencil maker; his mother was Cynthia Dunbar. He later reversed his first and middle names (after college) but never legally changed them.

Concord would remain the center of Thoreau's world—he was born there, educated there, worked there, wrote there, and died there. His famous walks rarely took him more than ten miles from home, yet his observations achieved universal significance.

## Surveying Career

Thoreau supported himself largely through **professional surveying**—a fact crucial to understanding his connection to the Strata package.

### Surveying Highlights
- Conducted approximately **200 surveys** in his career
- Surveyed Walden Pond three times (1846, 1854, 1860)
- Created detailed bathymetric map with over 100 soundings
- Used compass, chain, and sounding line
- Known for exceptional accuracy

### Walden Pond Survey (1846)
> "I surveyed it carefully, before the ice broke up, early in '46, with compass and chain and sounding line."

- Measured maximum depth: 102 feet
- Created map at scale of 10 rods to the inch
- Over 100 soundings recorded
- Discovered geometric relationship between depth and shoreline shape

### The Surveyor's Philosophy
> "It is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it."

Thoreau saw surveying not as mere measurement but as a form of knowledge—direct engagement with the physical world rather than speculation or hearsay.

## Quotes

> "I fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone weighing about a pound and a half, and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom."

> "It is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it."

> "I surveyed it carefully, before the ice broke up, early in '46, with compass and chain and sounding line."

> "When I had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch, and put down the soundings, more than a hundred in all, I observed this remarkable coincidence."

> "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life."

## Connection to Strata Package

Thoreau embodies the **data acquisition** philosophy of `strata.thoreau`: **go to the source**. Just as Thoreau would not accept hearsay about Walden Pond's depth but went out with his sounding line to measure it himself, the Thoreau module fetches data directly from authoritative sources—the Census Bureau's TIGER files, Quebec's open data portal, Canada's CanVec database.

The surveyor's practical wisdom applies: don't speculate about boundaries when you can fetch the authoritative shapefile.
